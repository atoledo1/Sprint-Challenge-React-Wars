1. What is React JS and what problems does it solve? Support your answer with concepts introduced in class and from your personal research on the web.

It is a library that serves to build the UI.  Because you divide things into components, it really simplifies the building of large applications and it is also very helpful when you are dealing with dynamic data because of the virtual dom. 

2. Describe component state.

The component state is the object that determines what the component does. When it changes, it re-renders and thus the component is updated. It is what makes it dynamic and interactive. 

3. Describe props. 

Props works as a kind of place holder than then you can populate with custom data. 

4. What are side effects, and how do you sync effects in a React component to changes of certain state or props?
 
 Side effects are the things that are happening outside of the scope of the function being used. An example of a side effect that this project deals with is the calling of the API. You are able to sync effects with the useState hook or the useEffect hook.
